    <p>This portfolio for Frontend Engineer Daniel Sternlicht is pretty close to what I want to create for my first project in Interactive Media II. While my inspiration is pulling from Super Mario on the Super Nintendo, he is pulling from Pokemon on Game Boy, which I am also a fan of from childhood.</p>
    <p>There are certain aspects of his site I find inspiring and would like to emulate. You can navigate Sternlicht's character into buildings and see parts of his portfolio. I would like to do something similar, but actually include interactive levels where the user can unlock niche parts of my portfolio. Overall, I will most likely be referencing Sternlicht's site structure when building my own project.</p>
